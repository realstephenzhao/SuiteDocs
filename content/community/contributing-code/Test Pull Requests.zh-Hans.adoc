Check out awaiting pull requests on our SuiteCRM repo https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/pulls[here].

Select a pull request that is ready to test e.g. https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/pull/6612

Obtain the author's repo. e.g. https://github.com/jack7anderson7/SuiteCRM
and the branch specific to the PR e.g. issue-6611

{{% notice tip %}}
You can find the user's repo by clicking on their username on the PR or you
could usually use the URL https://github.com/{username}/SuiteCRM replacing
{username} with the author's username.
{{% /notice %}}

Now we have these essential pieces of information we can pull down the code to test.
Create a new branch using the base of the PR e.g. hotfix, hotfix-7.10.x or develop
within your SuiteCRM fork directory.
Name the new branch uniquely if you want to test alot of PRs e.g. testing6611

`cd /name/of/your/forked/instance` +
`git checkout -b testing6614 hotfix`

Let's pull down the author's branch into our new test branch using the author's repo
and branch name we obtained earlier.
e.g. git pull {author's repo} {author's branch}

`git pull https://github.com/jack7anderson7/SuiteCRM.git issue-6611`

From the above command you will see the files that have been pulled down.

That's it! You are ready to test a pull request.

If the PR resolves the issue and there are no outstanding tasks then leave
a comment with the text "Assessed :+1:"
