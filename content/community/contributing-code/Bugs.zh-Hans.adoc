== Providing a Bug Fix

* To provide a code contribution for an issue you will need to set up
your own fork of the SuiteCRM repository, make your code changes, commit
the changes and make a Pull Request to the appropriate branch on the
SuiteCM repository. See our
link:../forking/[Quick Guide to Fork SuiteCRM]. Once you have set up your forked repository you can
begin making commits to the project. 

* First, determine which base branch your bug fix should use. 

{{%notice info%}}The `hotfix-7.10.x` branch will be merged into `hotfix` and the `develop` branch so unless your bug
is `hotfix` or `develop` specific, make the PR to `hotfix-7.10.x`.{{%/notice%}}

  hotfix-7.10x-->|Merged Into|hotfix;
  hotfix-->|Merged Into|develop;

* Separate each issue fix into a new branch in your repository (Either
from the `hotfix-7.10.x` or `hotfix` branch) and name it with the issue
ID e.g. _bugfix_3062_ or _issue-1234_.
+
e.g. to create the branch from `hotfix-7.10.x` with the following git command:
+
`git checkout -b _bugfix_3062_ upstream/hotfix-7.10.x`

* When committing to your individual bugfix branch, it helps to follow
the message format below:
+
`Fixed #1234 - <the subject of the issue>`
+
e.g of a commit command 
+
`git commit -m "Fixed #1436 - Reports with nested Parentheses are removing parameters"` + 
+
This commit message format allows us to easily include all bug
fixes within major and minor *Release notes*.
+
If you are new to Writing Commit Messages in git follow the guide
http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules[here].

* When pushing a branch that has been created from an upstream branch 
to your remote fork, you will need to specify "origin", e.g.
+
`git push origin _bugfix_3062_`

=== Make a Bug Fix Pull Request

* After you have made your commits and pushed them up to your forked
repository you then create a
http://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/[Pull Request] to be
reviewed and merged into the SuiteCRM repository. Make a new Pull
Request for each issue you fix – *do not* combine multiple bugfixes into
one Pull Request.

* Ensure that in your Pull Request that the base fork is
*salesagility/SuiteCRM* and base branch is either `hotfix-7.10.x` or `hotfix`
with the head fork being *your repository* and a base branch of your unique bugfix branch e.g. _bugfix_1234_

* We will automatically reject any Pull Requests made to the wrong
branch!

=== CLA Check

If you have not signed our
https://www.clahub.com/agreements/salesagility/SuiteCRM[CLA]
(Contributor License Agreement) then your Pull Request will fail a check
and won't be able to be merged into the project. You will only be required to sign
this once.

=== Travis CI

When a new Pull Request is opened, Travis CI will test the merging of
the origin and upstream branch and update the Pull Request. If this
check fails you can review the test results and resolve accordingly. To
test prior to making a Pull Request install PHPUnit via composer into
your develop environment then cd into the tests directory and run:

`sh runtests.sh`
