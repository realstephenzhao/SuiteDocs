== Contribute with comments, corrections or questions

In order to contribute to the Documentation efforts, you can open issues regarding pages directly on GitHub 
which is the repository of our content.

You need a https://github.com/join[Github user account^] to open issues on the SuiteCRM Documentation Site. 
If you don't have one yet, you will be given the opportunity to create one during this process.

=== 1. Navigate to the place you want to comment on 

Simply use your browser to go to the relevant page. You can use the menus 
and search feature to facilitate this.

=== 2. Click "Issue"

Every page on the site has an "Issue" link near the top.

It's important to realize that these Issues are about the Documentation page, not about SuiteCRM itself. 
So please direct any technical questions or feature requests to the https://community.suitecrm.com[Forums^].

Here, you can ask about something that needs to be clarified in the Documentation, 
suggest an additional aspect to cover in this page, or tell us about anything that 
you found wrong about the page.

When you're done, click the green button 
at the bottom that is labeled btn:[Submit new issue].

=== That's it, you're done!

Your proposed Issue is now up handed over to the members of the Community in charge of the 
SuiteCRM Documentation site. They will receive an e-mail notification as soon as you finish your Issue.

You can check the status of every Issue, and participate in any discussion 
about them by visiting https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteDocs/issues[this list^].

Every small contribution matters! Thanks for helping out.
